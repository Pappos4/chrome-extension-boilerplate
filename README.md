# React Chrome Extension Webpack Boilerplate

This repository is a boilerplate for developing Chrome extensions with React and Webpack. The development environment is set up with hot-reloading, source maps, and other useful features for a seamless development process.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the project as specified in the package.json file.

This will create a new folder `dist` that contains the build files which you can load as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Loading the extension into Chrome
